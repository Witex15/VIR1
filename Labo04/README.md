# Labo04 - A first stateless microservice

## Pedagogical intent

This lab will certainly be a little more complex than the previous ones, but it's excellent preparation for the rest of the module project.

Here are the skills trained:
* Discover spring MVC architecture for REST api backend applications,
* Deploying a 2-tier application in Docker using a DockerCompose file,
* Use input parameters to launch containers,
* Test api calls to your Dockerized application via curl.
